Things to consider when implementing error handing:

Is your '-r' option really optional? It should be.

Do you check for two files as command line arguments? //???

Do you verify that each file exists?

Do you verify that each file has all required values?

For example, if it's an N by N matrix, does each of the N rows have N numeric values?

Do you accept spaces in asset names?

Do you verify that each input that should be numeric is numeric?

For this assignment, values that should be numeric but aren't (nulls, spaces, words, etc...) can be reported as errors.

Testcases:
incorrect number of command lines!
//(blank)
//universe.csv

"Only accept filenames and '-r' option!"
//-m unviverse.csv correlation.csv

universe file open fails!
//universe_err0.csv

universe file is empty!
//universe_err1.csv

encounter non-numeric input!
//universe_err2.csv

a name field does not have its required value in universe file!
//universe_err3.csv

correlation file open fails!
//correlation_err0.csv

correlation file is empty!
//correlation_err1.csv

encounter non-numeric input!
//correlation_err2.csv

unmatched number for asset names and number for correlations(numColumn)
//correlation_err3.csv

unmatched number for asset names and number for correlations(numRow)
//correlation_err4.csv

data value incorrect in correlation matrix!
//correlation_err5.csv

more data in universe file than required
//universe_err4.csv

more data in correlation file than required
//correlation_err6.csv
//correlation_err7.csv
